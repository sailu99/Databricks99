    "The approach just described can become quite tedious when creating a large grid of subplots, especially if you'd like to hide the x- and y-axis labels on the inner plots. For this purpose, `plt.subplots()` is the easier tool to use (note the s at the end of subplots). Rather than creating a single subplot, this function creates a full grid of subplots in a single line, returning them in a NumPy array. The arguments are the number of rows and number of columns, along with optional keywords `sharex` and `sharey`, which allow you to specify the relationships between different axes.\n",
